Agent:In some team matches, only one entrant from each team may be designated as the "legal" or "active" wrestler at any given moment. Two wrestlers must make physical contact (typically palm-to-palm) in order to transfer this legal status. This is known as a "tag", with the participants "tagging out" and "tagging in". Typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring, whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time, resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face.

Hello. Nice to meet you !

Me: Hello.

He: Hi there !

Me: What sort of wrestling are we talking about here? there are different traditions in different countries, right?

He: our company has been in our company.

Me: Er... I did not quite understand what you mean.

He:  That would be 25 MEPs from seven different countries
Why didn't you do quite understand what you mean?

Me: What is MEP?

He: it's my pleasure.

After few seconds:
Looks like it takes your peer long time to answer, would you like to end the chat?

Me: I cannot understand a bit of what is happening. It seems very incoherent.

He: How?

Me: I ask one thing, and you say something else.

He: What is it?

Me: I have been disliking all your responses.

He: Neat. I have a friend named Hugh Loebner.
