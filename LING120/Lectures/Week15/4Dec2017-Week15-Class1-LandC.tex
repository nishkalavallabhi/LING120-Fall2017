\frametitle{Question from last week}
\begin{itemize}
\item Question: What concepts we discussed are useful to solve the "spooky author classification" problem on Kaggle.com?
\item Some of your answers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Text classification (It is a classification problem -identifying one of the three categories i.e., author names)
\item bag-of-words, n-grams (it turns out: character n-grams are very useful, even more than bag-of words for this task!)
\item Frequency of Nouns, Pronouns etc.
\item Regular expressions can be used to look for patterns of words that show up in close proximity
\end{itemize}
